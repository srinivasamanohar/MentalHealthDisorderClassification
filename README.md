## Introduction

Mental health challenges are increasingly prevalent, necessitating efficient systems for early detection and intervention. This project aims to:
1. Detect and classify mental health conditions like Normal, Depression, Suicidal, Anxiety, Stress, Bipolar Disorder, and Personality Disorder.
2. Enhance sensitivity to linguistic context for accurate predictions.
3. Support applications like therapeutic chatbots and social media monitoring for mental health trends.

The project utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze and classify mental health conditions based on textual data.

## Features

- **Bayesian Neural Network**: Incorporates uncertainty estimation for sensitive applications.
- **LSTM Models**: Leverage sequential patterns in text for accurate classification.
- **Pre-trained Embeddings**: Uses GloVe embeddings for feature extraction.
- **Dataset**: Curated from various social media platforms to encompass diverse mental health contexts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-health-classification.git
   cd mental-health-classification
